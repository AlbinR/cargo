# **Cargo**: Rent or Rent out your car

---

> Hello, my name is Albin Ryberg i have made a prototype app for one of my projects.

## About this project.

---

This "App" is the second part in the ux course about implementation of design and functionality. This app is made in react with basic firebase authentication. The design is copied (to the best of my ability) from a [figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/Dxo5dsipp2ihV3CjlQbjVm/CarGo-H%C3%A5llbart-Resande-Grupp-5).

Cargo is an app that lets you rent out or rent cars near you. Reducing the amount of cars owned and in turn reducing CO2 emissions.
